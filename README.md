# Automated testing
In this repository I learn how to configure automated tests with tox, github actions and pytest.
This file will contain notes regarding creating configuration files, tests etc.

## Background (Statistics In Biomedicine)
To make this project both useful for learning and useful as a tool I decided to make it a package.
This will be set of functions that cover subjects of Statistics In Biomedicine.
I'll try to add simple explanation to each function in doc-string.
